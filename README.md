## Research on community college expenditures, revenues, and efficiency



### Overview
This repository contains the R code used to produce the [Community College Research Center](http://ccrc.tc.columbia.edu/) report entitled:
* [Can Community Colleges Afford to Improve Completion? Measuring the Costs and Efficiency Effects of College Reforms](http://ccrc.tc.columbia.edu/publications/can-community-colleges-afford-to-improve-completion.html)


### Shiny+R
The repository also contains the R/Shiny files for a simple interactive web application that allows users to run their own cost simulations by modifying the change parameter. The Shiny site was not meant to be a companion to the paper, but rather it was created as an example of a type of dashboard that could be of use to stakeholders. This application has been hosted at http://chagall.tc.columbia.edu/shiny/ncsim/. However, this is not a production server and thus there is no guarantee of availability.

### Paper Abstract
Community colleges are under pressure to increase completion rates and efficiency despite limited evidence of the economic consequences of different reform strategies. This paper introduces an economic model of student course pathways linked to college expenditures and revenues. Using detailed data from a single college, the authors calculate baseline efficiency and differences in efficiency for students who follow different pathways. They also simulate changes in output, expenditures, revenues, net revenues, and efficiency assuming that the college meets particular performance targets.

The findings indicate substantial differences in efficiency across pathways and significant differences in efficiency across strategies to help students complete college. The Findings also suggest that increasing the completion rate is difficult and typically requires additional resources beyond the costs of implementing particular strategies. The model has wide practical application for community colleges.
